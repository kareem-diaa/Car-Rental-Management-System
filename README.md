## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The Car Rental Management System follows the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern, structured as follows:

```
📂 src/
 ┣ 📂 models/            # Domain models representing business entities
 ┣ 📂 dao/               # Data Access Objects for database operations
 ┣ 📂 controllers/       # Controllers to handle business logic
 ┣ 📂 views/             # UI components and screens
 ┣ 📂 utils/             # Utility classes and helpers
 ┣ 📂 migrations/        # Database setup and migrations
 ┣ 📂 services/          # Business services (e.g., OTP service)
 ┣ 📂 resources/         # Configuration files
 ┣ 📂 assets/            # Images and other static resources
 ┗ 📂 fonts/             # Custom fonts for the application
```

This architecture provides:
- **Separation of concerns**: Each component has a clear responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one layer don't affect other layers
- **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
- **Flexibility**: Easy to extend or modify functionality

## 📦 Project Components

### 📊 Models

Models represent the business entities and encapsulate the data structure. Key models include:

- **Car**: Represents a vehicle available for rental
  - Attributes: ID, model, category, mileage, availability, price, etc.
  - Related models: `CarBrand`, `CarModel`, `Category`

- **Customer**: Represents a registered user
  - Attributes: ID, username, password hash, email, license number, etc.
  - Authentication and profile details

- **Booking**: Represents a car reservation
  - Attributes: ID, car ID, customer ID, dates, status, etc.
  - Links customers to cars for a specific period

- **Payment**: Handles financial transactions
  - Attributes: ID, booking ID, amount, status, date, method
  - Tracks all financial aspects of rentals

- **RentalHistory**: Records past rentals
  - Attributes: ID, booking ID, return date, condition notes, etc.
  - Maintains a history of all completed rentals

- **Maintenance**: Tracks vehicle upkeep
  - Attributes: ID, car ID, date, description, cost, etc.
  - Records all maintenance activities for each vehicle

- **Review**: Customer feedback about rentals
  - Attributes: ID, booking ID, rating, comments, date
  - Allows customers to rate their rental experience

### 🗄️ DAO Layer

The Data Access Object (DAO) layer provides an abstraction between the database and the application. Each DAO class:

- Handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Manages SQL queries and database connections
- Maps database records to model objects

Key DAO classes:

- **CarDAO**: Manages car data in the database
  - Methods: `insertCar()`, `getCarById()`, `updateCar()`, `deleteCar()`, etc.
  - Handles car-specific database operations

- **CustomerDAO**: Manages customer accounts
  - Methods: `registerCustomer()`, `getCustomerByUsername()`, `verifyCustomer()`, etc.
  - Handles customer authentication and profile management

- **BookingDAO**: Manages rental bookings
  - Methods: `createBooking()`, `getBookingsByCustomer()`, `updateBookingStatus()`, etc.
  - Handles reservation-related database operations

All DAO classes follow a similar pattern, providing a consistent interface for database operations while encapsulating SQL complexity.

### 🎮 Controllers

Controllers act as intermediaries between the Views and the Models/DAOs. They:

- Validate user input before processing
- Implement business logic
- Call appropriate DAO methods
- Return results to the Views

Key controllers:

- **CarController**: Manages car-related operations
  - Methods: `addCar()`, `updateCar()`, `deleteCar()`, `getCarById()`, etc.
  - Validates car data before database operations

- **BookingController**: Handles rental bookings
  - Methods: `createBooking()`, `cancelBooking()`, `getActiveBookings()`, etc.
  - Manages the booking workflow and status transitions

- **LoginController**: Handles user authentication
  - Methods: `loginCustomer()`, `loginAdmin()`, `verifyCredentials()`
  - Securely authenticates users and manages sessions

### 🖼️ Views

Views are the user interface components built with Java Swing. The application uses FlatLaf for a modern look and feel. Key views include:

- **LoginView**: User authentication screen
  - Components: Username/password fields, login button
  - Functionality: Authenticate users, reset password

- **AdminDashboard**: Main admin interface
  - Components: Navigation menu, summary statistics
  - Functionality: Access to all admin functions

- **AvailableCarsView**: Displays cars for rental
  - Components: Car listing table, filters, booking button
  - Functionality: Browse and select cars for rental

- **BookingView**: Booking creation interface
  - Components: Date pickers, customer details, payment options
  - Functionality: Complete the booking process

- **ManageCarView**: Car management interface
  - Components: Car listing, add/edit/delete buttons
  - Functionality: CRUD operations for car inventory

Each view is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, with consistent styling and navigation.

### 🔧 Utils

Utility classes provide common functionality used across the application:

- **MySQLConnection**: Database connection management (Singleton)
  - Methods: `getInstance()`, `getConnection()`
  - Maintains a single connection to the MySQL database

- **EmailUtil**: Email notification services
  - Methods: `sendVerificationEmail()`, `sendPasswordReset()`
  - Handles all email communications

- **HashUtil**: Password security
  - Methods: `hashPassword()`, `verifyPassword()`
  - Uses jBCrypt for secure password handling

- **ValidationUtil**: Input validation
  - Methods: `isValidEmail()`, `isValidPhone()`, etc.
  - Ensures data integrity before processing

- **AppColors**: UI color constants
  - Defines color scheme for consistent UI appearance

### 📜 Migrations

The migration system automates database setup and schema changes:

- **DBMigration**: Database setup and schema management
  - Methods: `migrate()`, `applyMigration()`
  - Creates all required tables and initial data

---

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- MySQL Server 5.7 or higher
- MySQL Connector/J 9.1.0
- (Optional) An IDE such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans

2. **Configure database connection**
   - Edit `src/resources/DBPropFile.properties` with your MySQL credentials
   - Ensure MySQL server is running

3. **Add required libraries**
   - All required JAR files are in the `lib/` directory
   - Add these to your build path if not already included

4. **Compile the project**
   - Use your IDE's build functionality or compile manually

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Database Configuration

Edit the `src/resources/DBPropFile.properties` file:
```properties
MYSQL_DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/car_rental
USER=your_username
PASSWORD=your_password
```

### Email Configuration

Edit the `src/resources/smtp.properties` file:
```properties
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com

## 📊 Database Setup

To initialize the database:

1. **Create a MySQL database**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE car_rental;
   ```

2. **Run migrations**
   - Uncomment the migration code in `Main.java`
   - Run the application once to create all tables
   - Re-comment the migration code for subsequent runs

The migration system will automatically create all required tables, indexes, and relationships.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

1. **Compile and run the Main class**
   ```bash
   javac -cp "lib/*" -d bin src/car_rental/Main.java
   java -cp "bin;lib/*" car_rental.Main
   ```

2. **Login**
   - Use the default admin credentials (check admin_passwords.txt)
   - Or register a new customer account

3. **Navigate the interface**
   - Use the menu options to access different features
